How we approach clearing and resetting surfaces depends entirely on our intended purpose for that surface.
For example, our kitchen table serves a different purpose than a bookshelf, which is again different from that of an entryway table. 
We can group surfaces into three rough categories: workspace, permanent storage, and temporary storage.

Workspaces are any surface where an activity is meant to happen: primarily desks, tables, and counters.
Any surface that is the home of another object is permanent storage. Most surfaces in this category can be thought of as shelves in one way or another. 
Finally, temporary storage. This category comprises your landing zones:
the spots you throw your mail when you get home or the library book you need to return. 

Without much fuss, every surface in your house can be categorized into one of these three groups. 
Of course, some surfaces take up multiple roles. 
Your kitchen counters, for example, are partially workspaces and partially a home for your knife block or utensil crock.
The top of a dresser might house a vase you like and your outfit for tomorrow. 
But every surface plays at least one of these functions, and its critically important that you make a conscious decision which.

When we have too many things, it's easy for permanent storage to overrun the other categories. 
Suddenly, every activity requires a stuff-shuffle, and both our possessions and our activity suffer.
Our possessions no longer have a defined home and we no longer act with any spontaneity. 

But the more common problem precedes the above: a complete lack of intention with our surfaces.
Not even that there's too much stuff. 
Simply that there aren't defined locations for each thing.
What's on your kitchen table right now? The top of your dressers?
I'd wager that there's more than you'd like. 
And I'd wager that those things stop you from using the surface the way you'd like.

What to do, what to do!
You may be tempted to begin with reflection: what do I want the surface to be used for?
Stop! 
You're on the right track, but getting ahead of yourself.
**Reflection is step 2. Clearing is step 1.**
Remove everything from the surface, even the things you anticipate will return to it.
Remove everything from the surface, even if that means more or bigger piles on another.
Remove everything from the surface, including the dust, the dirt, and the grime.
Once the surface is clear, you're ready for reflection.

The first question to ask: is this a workspace, a home, a landing zone, or a combination?
*Workspaces must be clear, usually at least 90%, to function correctly.*
If a surface is a workspace, what activities is it going to support? 
The more activities it needs to support, the clearer it needs to be.
It should not be made housing for more than is absolutely necessary.
For example, a monitor or keyboard are entirely appropriate for a desk.
A knife block is appropriate for a kitchen counter. 
But a table meant to support multiple different activities should, as much as possible, be kept completely clear.
